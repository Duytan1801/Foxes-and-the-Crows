bruh bruh skibidi lmao

Testing out using PGM and probabilistic reasoning combined with casual reasoning as a "reasoning" part for LLMs, my goal is using the LLMs as a encoder and extractor from the world into abstract data.
For example in books, LLMs can easily extracting casual reasoning from sciencetific books then constract the abstract graph from it.
In my oppinion, the most fundamental form of reasoning was to connecting the abstract datas so this repo is to testing that out.
